# 2019summerProject
Desktop application written in TSQL, C# and ADO.Net


# Project Timeline
<pre>
July 1 - September 16
~12 Weeks before 1st day of class, Fall quarter (9/23)

Week 1-2: July 1-14
[] 1. Finalize participating members
[] 2. Decide what skills we all want to either brush up on or hone. For example, creating a bound form with the ability to edit 2 different sources of data like you might have done in our final Project Application. The goal by the
end of the summer is to be very comfortable with these topics and be able to use them without difficulty.
[] 3. Find an interesting idea or way to make the project fun for us, after all it is our break! This could be making an application you could use at home such as a recipe database, or anything else you can think of.
[] 4. Create Github accounts and figuring out a central place to communicate through, such as Discord.

Week 3: July 15-21
[] 5. Create project plan and assign tasks.  Once a project idea is selected, figure out how to divide the work without stepping on each other's toes. The idea is to make the project's components as modular as possible so by final couple weeks we just have to assemble it all together and polish any final details. This idea goes back to what Randy was trying to get at when we made business object classes and how they know nothing about the Forms they may be used in.

Week 4: July 22-28
[] 6. Form small teams to begin work. Each team is entirely responsible for their work, and each team is responsible for updating the other teams on any changes that may affect the other team's work.

Week 5-6: July 29 - August 11
[] 7. Continue project work, teams should have the majority of their work finished by end of Week 6. With Week 4 through Week6, that's a little under 21 days of coding to complete your tasks.

Week 7-8: August 12-26
[] 8. Begin assembling project. Debug & Run project tests</br>
[] 9. Pat each other on the back
